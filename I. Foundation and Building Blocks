Foundation and Building Blocks

- Data engineering is one of the hottest fields in data and technology.
- It builds the foundation for data science and analytics in production.

- How the field was born? How is the evolution? The skills that must have of good data engineers and with whom they work?

What is Data Engineering?
  Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.
  The intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.
  A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data (use cases, analysis, machine learning).

Data Engineering Lifecycle
  The stages of the data engineering lifecycle are as follows:
Generation --> Storage --> Ingestion --> Transformation --> Serving
